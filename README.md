[the MTGATracker releases page](https://github.com/mtgatracker/mtgatracker/releases) instead!**

Files MTGATracker wants for automatic updates (for now, windows only). Update files are uploaded to 
Releases in this repo, for usage with [electron-gh-releases](https://github.com/jenslind/electron-gh-releases).

This repo has no code, and releases are not linked to source. This repo is strictly for use by the automatic updater
built in to MTGATracker.
